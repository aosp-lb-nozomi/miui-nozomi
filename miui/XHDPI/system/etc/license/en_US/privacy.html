			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
			This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, hold, use, disclose and transfer your personal information in connection with our services.  In this document when we use the terms “we” or “us” it is a reference to Xiaomi Inc.
			</p>
			<p>
			You consent to our collection, holding, use, disclosure and transfer of your personal information for the purposes and in the manner set out below when you submit your personal information to us and  use our services.  If you do not agree or accept this Privacy Policy, please immediately discontinue use of our services. The confidentiality of our customers' information is of utmost importance to us. We would like to assure you that we respect the information you have shared with us and that we are committed to protect your personal information in compliance with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act 2012.   
			</p>
			<p>
			There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. 
			</p>
			
			<div class="neirong">
			<h3>Information we collect</h3>
			<p>
			We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.
			</p>
			<p>
			The types of personal information we collect from you depends on the type of products and services you request from us.  However, it may include your name, username, contact details, billing information, transaction details and credit card information. The information gathered will help us to complete a transaction, to communicate with you and update you on our service and benefits.We collect information in two ways:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="li_title">Information you give us.</span> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Xiaomi Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, or telephone number.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="li_title">Information we get from your use of our services.</span> We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them. This information includes:
					<ol>
						<li class="li_title">Device information</li>
						<li>
							We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Xiaomi may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Xiaomi Account.
						</li>
						<li class="li_title">Log information</li>
						<li>
							When you use our services or view content provided by Xiaomi, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
							<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
								<li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</li>
								<li>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</li>
								<li>Internet protocol address.</li>
								<li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
								<li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Xiaomi Account.</li>
								<li>If you’d like to opt out of Xiaomi’s User Experience program, which sends some of your information anonymously to our servers, you can do so at any time in Settings. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="li_title">Unique application numbers</li>
						<li>
							Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Xiaomi when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.
						</li>
						<li class="li_title">
							Local storage
						</li>
						<li>
							We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
						</li>
						<li class="li_title">
							Cookies and anonymous identifiers
						</li>
						<li>
							We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Xiaomi service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device.  For security reasons, you may wish to deactivate the storing of cookies or adjust your browser to inform you before the cookies are stored on your computer.  However, if you do erase or block the cookies, you may not be able to utilize some features on our website.  We shall not in any way, be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from your inability to use such features on your device.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>How we use information we collect</h3>
			<p>
				We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Xiaomi and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may use the name and photo you provide for your Xiaomi Account across all of the services we offer. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Xiaomi Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Xiaomi Account information.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you contact Xiaomi, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Xiaomi services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.

			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
